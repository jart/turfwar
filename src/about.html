<h1>Welcome to the IPv4 Games</h1>
<p>I have a simple challenge for you:
<p><a href="/">Send requests to my web server</a> from lots of <em>different</em> IP addresses.


<h2>How Scoring Works</h2>
<p>The server keeps a record of what name was last sent to it from each IPv4 address.
<p>If you hold more IPv4 addresses in a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks">/8 address block</a>
    than anyone else, that means you control that block.
<p>Each block you control gives you 1 point.

<h2>How did you make this?</h2>
<p>The frontend is plain HTML and JavaScript. (Just view the page's source!)
    The backend is about 200 lines of Lua running inside a
    <a href="https://redbean.dev/">redbean server</a>
    (which gives us this convenient
    <a href="/statusz">server health endpoint</a> for free.)
